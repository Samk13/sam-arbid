                        After my career as a VFX artist and coming close to the
                        oskar prize I looked for exploring a new career that is
                        more useful for society. In the end i decided coding is
                        the best way of doing this, but before that while I was
                        living in the countryside, I served as a part time
                        firefighter in Karlsborg. At the same time I got
                        certified at lernia as carpenter and worked with
                        swedishmodules in vara until I moved to the capital
                        stockholm.
